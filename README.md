# Apple ID Registration Bot

This Python script automates the registration process for Apple IDs using Playwright for browser automation and TwoCaptcha for solving captchas.

## Description

The bot is designed to register multiple Apple IDs simultaneously. It uses Playwright to launch Firefox browsers, fills registration forms with randomly generated names, and verifies accounts through email and SMS. Proxies and captchas can be optionally used to bypass restrictions and solve challenges.
