# Apple ID Registration Bot

This Python script automates the registration process for Apple IDs using Playwright for browser automation and CapMonster for solving captchas.
Capmonster is used because it is the best, fast in solution, and cheap, and I recommend it to all sites

## Description

The bot is designed to register multiple Apple IDs simultaneously. It uses Playwright to launch Firefox browsers, fills registration forms with randomly generated names, and verifies accounts through email and SMS. Proxies and captchas can be optionally used to bypass restrictions and solve challenges.
